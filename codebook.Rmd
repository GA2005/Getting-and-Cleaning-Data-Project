This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
This program is intended to show the Tidy dataset. 

Part1: 
The program downloads the file from the file location. 
sets working directory of the Project
Download the Dataset from the url location
unzip the file to the data location. Reads all th files to respective variables of the dataframes.

```{r}
setwd ("C://DataSceince//cleaning data//Week4//Project")

if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./data/Dataset.zip")

unzip(zipfile="./data/Dataset.zip",exdir="./data")

## Set working directory of the dataset
setwd ("C://DataSceince//cleaning data//Week4//Project//data//UCI HAR Dataset")
xtest <- read.table(".//test//X_test.txt", sep = "")

## Read all the
ytest <- read.table(".//test//y_test.txt", sep = "")
subtest <- read.table(".//test//subject_test.txt", sep = "")
xtrain <- read.table(".//train//X_train.txt", sep="")
ytrain <- read.table(".//train//y_train.txt", sep ="")
subtrain <- read.table(".//train//subject_train.txt", sep ="")
activity_lab <- read.table(".//activity_labels.txt")
features <- read.table(".//features.txt")
```
Part2: The Dataset is named  with the labels made from the Subject, Activity  and feature names extracted from the features dataframe.
The Train and Test Datasets are merged by using appropriate Binding functions to create a combined dataset. Testing of the dataset is performed using the str functions to check the validity of the data frames

```{r}
names(subtrain)<- "subject"
names(ytrain)<-"activity"
names(xtrain)<-features$V2

train<- cbind(ytrain,xtrain)
str(train)
train_s <- cbind(subtrain,train)
str(train_s)
names(subtest)<- "subject"
names(ytest)<- "activity"
names(xtest)<-features$V2

test<- cbind(ytest,xtest)
str(test)
Test_s<- cbind(subtest,test)
str(Test_s)
Bind_all<- rbind(Test_s,train_s)
str(Bind_all)
featurename<- features$V2[grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)",features$V2)]
```
Part3: The mean and standard deviation columns are extracted from the dataset along with the activity and subjects. 
```{r}
selectedNames<-c(as.character(featurename), "subject", "activity" )
selectedNames
Data_all <- subset(Bind_all,select=selectedNames)
```
Part4: The Activity names are substituted via a lookup list from the qdaptools package.
```{r}
library(qdapTools)
Data_all$activity <-lookup(Data_all$activity, (activity_lab$V1), c("WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING"))
```
Part5: Descritive names for t-time, Acc-Accelerometer are named for the columns of the Dataframe
```{r}
names(Data_all)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(Data_all))
names(Data_all)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(Data_all))
names(Data_all)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(Data_all))
names(Data_all)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(Data_all))
names(Data_all)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(Data_all))
Data_all
```
Part6: An independent tidy dataset is created with averaging each variable with activity and subject using the dplyr library. The tidy Dataset is generatared as a txt file.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
data_summary <- group_by(Data_all,subject,activity)
data_summary
data_sum<-summarise_each(data_summary,funs(mean))
data_sum
write.table(data_sum, file = "tidydata.txt",row.name=FALSE)
```
